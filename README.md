# AI Image Enhancer (React + Vite)

This is a modern *AI Image Enhancer* web application built using *React* and *Vite*. The app provides an intuitive interface where users can upload images and receive AI-enhanced versions, with real-time previews.

> Upload your image and let AI do the magic!

## Features

- Upload image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- AI-based image enhancement support (API integration ready)
- Real-time before/after preview
- Loading spinner during processing
- Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- Vite JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios (for API requests)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## How It Works

1. User selects an image using the upload component.
2. The image is previewed on the screen.
3. On clicking "Enhance", the image is sent to an AI endpoint (API integration placeholder).
4. The enhanced version is returned and displayed alongside the original.

Thankyou!!!
